## Rules for the Design of Mobile Equipment for Continuous Handling of Bulk Materials

### SCOPE OF THE RULES

The purpose of these rules is to determine the loads and combinations of loads which must be taken into account when designing handling appliances, and also to establish the strength and stability conditions to be observed for the various load combinations.

### FIELD OF APPLICATION
These rules are applicable to mobile equipment for continuous handling of bulk materials, especially to rail-mounted:
- stackers
- shiploaders
- reclaimers
- combined stackers and reclaimers
- continuous ship unloaders

For other equipment, such as:
- excavators,
- scrapers,
- reclaimers with scraper chains,
- tyre or crawler-mounted stackers and/or reclaimers,

the clauses in these design rules appropriate to each type of apparatus are applicable.

It should be noted that when a mobile machine includes one or several belt conveyors as conveying elements, the clauses of these design rules, insofar as they apply to the machine in question, are applicable.

The selection of the conveyors should be made in accordance with the standard IS0 5048 : “Continuous mechanical handling equipment - Belt conveyors with carrying idlers - Calculation of operating power and tensile forces”.

On the other hand, belt conveyors which are not part of a mobile machine are excluded from the scope of these design rules.
