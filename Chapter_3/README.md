## Calculating the Stresses in Structures

The stresses set up in the various structural members are determined for the three load cases defined in section 2-3, and a check is made to ensure that, when compared with the critical stresses, the factor of safety v is adequate for the following three possible causes of failure:

- exceeding the elastic limit,
- exceeding the critical crippling or buckling load,
- and, eventually, exceeding the limit of endurance to fatigue.

The grade of the steel used must be stated and the physical properties, chemical composition and weldability must be guaranteed by the manufacturer of the material.

The permissible stresses for the materials used should be determined as stipulated in clauses 3-2, 3-3, 3-4 and 3-5 hereunder, based on the critical stresses for the material.

The critical stresses are those which correspond either to the elastic limit or the stress corresponding to the critical limit for elongation as appropriate, or to the critical stress for crippling or buckling, or, in the case of fatigue, to the stress for which the probability of survival, under tests, is 90 %.

The suitability of the selected material to resist brittle fracture should be assessed as outlined in section 3-l.

The stresses in the structural members should be calculated on the basis of the different load cases as defined in section 2-3 by applying conventional strength of materials calculation procedures.

The sections of metal to be considered shall be the gross sections (i.e. without deducting the areas of holes) for all parts which are subjected to compression loads (I), and the net sections (i.e. with the areas of holes deducted) for all parts subjected to tensile loads.

In the case of a member subjected to bending, a half-net section should be assumed, taking the net section in parts under tension and the gross section in parts under compression. To simplify the calculations, however, one may use either the section modulus of the net section or the section modulus computed for the half-net section, using as centre of gravity of the section that of the gross section.
