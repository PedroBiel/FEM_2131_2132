## Calculating the Stresses in Structures
### Checking Members Subjected to Fatigue

A risk of failure from fatigue occurs when a member is subjected to varying and/or repeated loads which may be considerably smaller than the static load capacity of the structure.

For structural members and joints the fatigue strength shall be checked for load case I forces (main loads) where these are expected to fluctuate significantly and where the total number of load cycles is expected to be more than 2.5 . lo5 in the anticipated lifetime of the machine.

All the static loads which may also occur in various magnitudes, for example incrustation, have to be calculated with that value which produces the highest tensile stress.

Fatigue strength is calculated by considering the following parameters:
1. the scheduled number of cycles of load variations to which the member is subjected
2. the material used and the notch category at the point being considered
3. the extreme maximum stress omax which can occur in the member
4. the ratio K between the values of the extreme stresses.

With these parameters, it is possible for the given number of load cycles to determine a permissible stress below which no damage is expected of variations of loading.
